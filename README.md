# dls-deep
Images for gnina/caffe GPU workloads.

Consisting of a base image (that might be generally useful) and a series
of additional images that add further GPU and deep-learning
(artificial neural-net) frameworks.

# Building
The images need to be built in the following order:-

-   base
-   rdkit
-   cuda
-   gnina
